# DishScan - YOLOv11 applied for pastry recognition

### Set up the dependencies

- All the required dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt` file, run the following command to install the dependencies using pip.

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Inference

- By default, the inference uses camera at index 0 as the input stream. You can configure this camera index by the variable `camera_index` in the `main.py` script.

- Run the main script via

```sh
python main.py
```

- The camera stream and YOLOv11 model takes about 30 seconds for initialization, after that, there will be a window represents the frame from the camera capture including the detected bounding boxes for bakery items.

### Evaluation

- We use Ultralytics built-in YOLO DetectionValidator for the model validation on a test dataset.

#### Prepare your test dataset

- Your datasets should be prepared inside the `/datasets` directory, in YOLO format.

- There should be 2 datasets: train and validation. The dataset should contain 2 sub-directories: `/images` for the images and the annotations in `/labels`.

- In the end, your train dataset should be at `/datasets/train` while your test dataset should be at `/datasets/valid`

#### Run the evaluation

- The evaluation script is prepared at `evaluation.py`, run it via

```sh
python evaluation.py
```

- The script will do the evaluation on your test dataset at `/datasets/valid` and output the results including Precision, Recall, mAP50, mAP50-95 and some visualizations.

- The results will be in a sub directory inside `runs/detect` directory, each run will produce a separate directory storing the results.

- The evaluation process produces some visualizations such as: 
  - confusion matrix.
  - curves for: F1, Precision, Recall, and Precision-Recall.
  - example instances from the test dataset, including the true labels and the predicted boxes.
